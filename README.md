A [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solution repository created by yours truly. All solution is written in Python 3. I use the challenge as a learning ground, so most (if not all) of the code will be badly written.

If you feel inclined to comment or criticize my work, by all means please do so. I'd love to hear what your take on it.


For you guys stuck in solving the puzzle, I kindly remind you not to look at this solution or any solution for that matter.  Solving it yourself is far more fulfilling.
